 <h2>About Cooper:</h2>
 <p>Cooper Pflaum is a noted Austrian furry, arsonist, and duelist of Canadian descent who didn't think to buy the domain cooperpflaum.com when creating a personal website. He was born at the age of six without a face, but stole one from a different six year old by the age of seven. His body has since aged, but his face has not.</p>
 <p>Pflaum studies cybersecurity as the University of Cincinnati in hopes of one day hacking area 51 to "Release the kraken". Notably his ex boyfriend was already going to do this before Pflaum killed him in a duel. He is one of the world's most prominent bug eaters, having eaten more than 573,856 praying mantei. He once mistook a pidgeon for a beetle and ate it whole.</p>
